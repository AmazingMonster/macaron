A C++ preprocessor library for metaprogramming testing.

## Introduction
This library started as a collection of boilerplates wrapped around static_assert. It was used when I was working on a metaprogramming library named *conceptrodon*.  
As conceptrodon grows more complicated, the sheer amount of boilerplates are both bothersome and error-prone.
Oftentimes a typo during testing could hide itself in plain sight as I debugged frustratedly inside the real code. Eventually, I made this library.
